# Data-Binding-- Communication Between TypeScript Code and HTML Template..

# Used to Output Data i.e from TypeScript to HTML
    #1 - String Interpolation --  {{ data }}
        -- To Output Some TEXT Use String Interpolation 
    
    #2 - Property Binding --  [property] = "data"
       -- To Change Some PROPERTY, HTML Element, Directive, Component use Property Binding 

    ###IMPORTANT -- Never Mix Them -- Breaks the APP   

# Used to React to (user)Events i.e from HTML to TypeScript
    #1 - Event Binding -- (event) = "expression"   


# Used for Two-Way binding
   #1 - [(ngModel)] = "data"
